<p>&ldquo;Touch This Page! Making Sense of the Ways We Read&rdquo; is an exhibition about multisensory experiences of reading. Its central objects are 3D replicas from historical books for blind and low-vision readers printed between 1830 and 1910. Most of these archival materials live at the <a href="https://www.perkins.org/history/visit/research-library">Samuel P. Hayes Research Library at the Perkins School for the Blind</a>. We hope that, by experiencing these 3D-printed objects, you will reflect on how touch, sight, and sound contribute to experiences of reading—historically and today. Simultaneously, the story of these tactile pages guides you through a particular slice of disability history and current barriers to access understood through the principles of universal design.</p>
<p>A pop-up style version of the exhibition was being hosted simultaneously at four locations during its initial launch: Harvard University’s <a href="https://library.harvard.edu/libraries/lamont">Lamont Library</a>, Northeastern University’s <a href="https://library.northeastern.edu/ideas/about-snell-library/">Snell Library</a>, the <a href="https://www.perkins.org/">Perkins School for the Blind</a>, and <a href="https://www.leventhalmap.org/">Norman B. Leventhal Map and Education Center</a> at the Boston Public Library (at Copley Square). It ran from the week of January 28, 2019 through mid-April 2019. The exhibition was then also hosted at the <a href="https://watertownlib.org/">Watertown Free Public Library</a> and NYU&rsquo;s <a href="https://library.nyu.edu/locations/elmer-holmes-bobst-library/">Bobst Library</a>. This web exhibition hosts all content from the physical exhibition including the files of the pages from the Perkins archive so that anyone with access to a 3D printer can reproduce the exhibition and its objects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Touch This Page!&rdquo; is co-directed by <a href="https://cssh.northeastern.edu/faculty/sari-altschuler/">Sari Altschuler</a> (Northeastern University) and <a href="https://www.newberry.org/about/staff-directory">David Weimer</a> (Newberry Library) and undertaken in collaboration with <a href="https://cssh.northeastern.edu/people/faculty/dan-cohen/">Dan Cohen</a> at the Northeastern Library, <a href="https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/meleis-waleed/">Waleed Meleis</a> at the Northeastern University College of Engineering, and Kim Charlson, Jennifer Arnott, and Jen Hale at the Perkins School for the Blind.</p>
<h2 id="news-and-awards">News and Awards</h2>
<p>In 2019 *Touch This Page! won the <a href="https://librarycompany.org/2019/10/01/innovation-prize-winners/">Library Company&rsquo;s inaugural Biennial Innovation Award</a>. The project was then featured in the Library Company&rsquo;s podcast, <a href="https://librarycompany.org/2020/01/31/talking-in-the-library-season-2-episode-5/">Talking in the Library</a>.</p>
<p>Andrew Leland worked closely with us and recorded <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-universal-page/">The Universal Page</a>, an episode of <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/">99% Invisible</a>, at the project&rsquo;s symposium in 2019.</p>
<h2 id="artefacts">Artefacts</h2>
<p>The artefacts for the exhibition were created in partnership with <a href="https://www.enablingengineering.org/">Enabling Engineering</a> at Northeastern University, the Harvard Library, and the Perkins School for the Blind. The <a href="https://history.fas.harvard.edu/digital_history">Digital History team of Harvard&rsquo;s History Department</a> lent us the 3D-scanner we used to produce these models.</p>
