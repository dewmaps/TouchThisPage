Making Sense of the Ways We Read&rdquo; is an exhibition about multisensory experiences of reading. Its central objects are 3D replicas from historical books for blind and low-vision readers printed between 1830 and 1910. Most of these archival materials live at the Samuel P. Hayes Research Library at the Perkins School for the Blind. We hope that, by experiencing these 3D-printed objects, you will reflect on how touch, sight, and sound contribute to experiences of reading—historically and today.">

<h2 id="touch-this-page---an-introduction">&ldquo;Touch This Page!&rdquo; - An Introduction</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Touch This Page! Making Sense of the Ways We Read&rdquo; is an exhibition about multisensory experiences of reading. Its central objects are 3D replicas from historical books for blind and low-vision readers printed between 1830 and 1910. Most of these archival materials live at the <a href="https://www.perkins.org/history/visit/research-library">Samuel P. Hayes Research Library at the Perkins School for the Blind</a>. We hope that, by experiencing these 3D-printed objects, you will reflect on how touch, sight, and sound contribute to experiences of reading—historically and today. Simultaneously, the story of these tactile pages guides you through a particular slice of disability history and current barriers to access understood through the principles of universal design.</p>
<p>A pop-up style version of the exhibition was being hosted simultaneously at four locations during its initial launch: Harvard University’s <a href="https://library.harvard.edu/libraries/lamont">Lamont Library</a>, Northeastern University’s <a href="https://library.northeastern.edu/ideas/about-snell-library/">Snell Library</a>, the <a href="https://www.perkins.org/">Perkins School for the Blind</a>, and <a href="https://www.leventhalmap.org/">Norman B. Leventhal Map and Education Center</a> at the Boston Public Library (at Copley Square). It ran from the week of January 28, 2019 through mid-April 2019. The exhibition was then also hosted at the <a href="https://watertownlib.org/">Watertown Free Public Library</a> and NYU&rsquo;s <a href="https://library.nyu.edu/locations/elmer-holmes-bobst-library/">Bobst Library</a>. This web exhibition hosts all content from the physical exhibition including the files of the pages from the Perkins archive so that anyone with access to a 3D printer can reproduce the exhibition and its objects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Touch This Page!&rdquo; is co-directed by <a href="https://cssh.northeastern.edu/faculty/sari-altschuler/">Sari Altschuler</a> (Northeastern University) and <a href="https://www.newberry.org/about/staff-directory">David Weimer</a> (Newberry Library) and undertaken in collaboration with <a href="https://cssh.northeastern.edu/people/faculty/dan-cohen/">Dan Cohen</a> at the Northeastern Library, <a href="https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/meleis-waleed/">Waleed Meleis</a> at the Northeastern University College of Engineering, and Kim Charlson, Jennifer Arnott, and Jen Hale at the Perkins School for the Blind.</p>
<h2 id="news-and-awards">News and Awards</h2>
<p>In 2019 *Touch This Page! won the <a href="https://librarycompany.org/2019/10/01/innovation-prize-winners/">Library Company&rsquo;s inaugural Biennial Innovation Award</a>. The project was then featured in the Library Company&rsquo;s podcast, <a href="https://librarycompany.org/2020/01/31/talking-in-the-library-season-2-episode-5/">Talking in the Library</a>.</p>
<p>Andrew Leland worked closely with us and recorded <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-universal-page/">The Universal Page</a>, an episode of <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/">99% Invisible</a>, at the project&rsquo;s symposium in 2019.</p>
<h2 id="artefacts">Artefacts</h2>
<p>The artefacts for the exhibition were created in partnership with <a href="https://www.enablingengineering.org/">Enabling Engineering</a> at Northeastern University, the Harvard Library, and the Perkins School for the Blind. The <a href="https://history.fas.harvard.edu/digital_history">Digital History team of Harvard&rsquo;s History Department</a> lent us the 3D-scanner we used to produce these models.</p>
