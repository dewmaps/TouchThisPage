      <description>How are you reading these words?&#xA;Looking at a screen? Feeling braille? Listening to a voice?&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Touch This Page!&amp;rdquo; asks you to think differently about reading. Each station offers a 3D reproduction of a page in a style invented for sighted and blind readers in the 1830s and 1840s. Unlike braille, these pages of raised text use or lightly adapt the Roman alphabet to make the words more easily legible to visual readers.</description>
