## Welcome to the *Touch This Page!* An exhibition on multisensory experiences of reading.

Touch This Page! makes the early history of inkless printing in the US available to anyone with access to a 3D printer.

This [exhibition](/exhibition) contextualizes these objects in the broader history of experiences of reading in the last 200 years. 

It originally ran in several sites on the east coast of the US in 2019. You can read more about it's history in our [about](/about) section.
