## Welcome to the "Touch This Page!" An exhibition on multisensory experiences of reading.

The central objects of "Touch This Page!" are 3D replicas from historical books for blind and low-vision readers printed between 1830 and 1910. Most of these archival materials live at the [Samuel P. Hayes Research Library at the Perkins School for the Blind](https://www.perkins.org/history/visit/research-library). We hope that, by experiencing these 3D-printed objects and 3D models, you will reflect on how touch, sight, and sound contribute to experiences of reading. Simultaneously, the story of these tactile pages guides you through a particular slice of disability history and current barriers to access understood through the principles of universal design.

This [exhibition](exhibition) hosts all the content from the physical exhibition including the files of the pages from Perkins so that anyone with access to a 3D printer can reproduce the exhibition and its objects.

It originally ran in several sites on the east coast of the US in 2019. You can read more about it's history in our [about section](about).
